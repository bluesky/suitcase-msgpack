    Export a stream of documents to msgpack.

    .. note::

        This can alternatively be used to write data to generic buffers rather
        than creating files on disk. See the documentation for the
        ``directory`` parameter below.

    Parameters
    ----------
    gen : generator
        expected to yield ``(name, document)`` pairs

    directory : string, Path or Manager.
        For basic uses, this should be the path to the output directory given
        as a string or Path object. Use an empty string ``''`` to place files
        in the current working directory.

        In advanced applications, this may direct the serialized output to a
        memory buffer, network socket, or other writable buffer. It should be
        an instance of ``suitcase.utils.MemoryBufferManager`` and
        ``suitcase.utils.MultiFileManager`` or any object implementing that
        interface. See the suitcase documentation at
        https://nsls-ii.github.io/suitcase for details.

    file_prefix : str, optional
        The first part of the filename of the generated output files. This
        string may include templates as in
        ``{start[proposal_id]}-{start[sample_name]}-``,
        which are populated from the RunStart document. The default value is
        ``{start[uid]}-`` which is guaranteed to be present and unique. A more
        descriptive value depends on the application and is therefore left to
        the user.

    **kwargs : kwargs
        Keyword arugments to be passed through to the underlying I/O library.

    Returns
    -------
    artifacts : dict
        dict mapping the 'labels' to lists of file names (or, in general,
        whatever resources are produced by the Manager)

    Examples
    --------

    Generate files with unique-identifier names in the current directory.

    >>> export(gen, '')

    Generate files with more readable metadata in the file names.

    >>> export(gen, '', '{start[plan_name]}-{start[motors]}-')

    Include the experiment's start time formatted as YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM.

    >>> export(gen, '', '{start[time]:%Y-%m-%d_%H:%M}-')

    Place the files in a different directory, such as on a mounted USB stick.

    >>> export(gen, '/path/to/my_usb_stick')
